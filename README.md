# 🧠 AI — From Theory to Code

This repository documents my learning journey in **Artificial Intelligence**, following one core principle:

> **Learn the theory first → understand the logic and math → then implement it in code and explain every step.**

Instead of just running code and chasing accuracy, my goal is to understand **what is happening, where it is happening, and why it is happening**.

This repository exists to clearly connect **AI theory with real implementations**.

## 📚 Where Is the Theory?

All theoretical concepts are explained on my **LinkedIn**, where I regularly share posts about:

- intuition behind algorithms  
- logical reasoning  
- mathematical foundations  
- why certain design choices work  

Only after understanding the theory do I move to implementation.

👉 **LinkedIn (Theory Posts):** *https://www.linkedin.com/in/umair-ali-6b2409215?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app*

You can think of:
- **LinkedIn** as the *theory classroom*
- **This GitHub repo** as the *practical lab*

## 🔗 Core Idea: Connecting Theory with Code

The main focus of this repository is **not just coding**, but **mapping theory to code**.

Inside the code, I have written **detailed comments** explaining:

- where the input enters the model  
- where kernels / filters are applied  
- where activation functions are used  
- where pooling happens  
- where forward propagation repeats  
- where backpropagation and gradient updates occur  
- where loss and accuracy are calculated  
- how predictions are made  

Anyone who understands the theory should be able to **open the code and immediately recognize the concepts**.

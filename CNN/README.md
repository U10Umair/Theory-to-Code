# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) — Theory to Code

This folder documents my complete learning process for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), where I first studied and explained the theoretical concepts (image representation, convolution using kernels, activation functions, pooling, feature extraction, classification, and backpropagation) and then implemented the same ideas in code with detailed comments. For the full theoretical explanations and intuition behind CNNs, please refer to my LinkedIn posts (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/umair-ali-6b2409215_behindthealgorithm-deeplearningbasics-neuralnetworks-activity-7419427228511514624-8kEy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADZYAKYBTpHzUDt--sj11lNJ4o5E7qzuxq4).

The implementation clearly shows where images enter the model, where kernels slide over the image, where activation and pooling happen, how gradients update during training, why training and validation accuracy can differ, and how predictions are made on new images. The goal of this work is not to build a perfect model, but to clearly connect CNN theory with its practical implementation so that anyone reading the code can directly see how theoretical concepts are executed in practice.
